# Discord-Bot-Core
A plugin for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that includes a Discord Bot + API allowing for other plugins to easily interact with Discord.

# Building
To build the plugin you will need to add the dependency JDA. This can be done with Mavin, Gradle and ANT. Currently ANT is being use in order to build this project although Mavin would be better.
